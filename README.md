# Salesman-Customer-System
SQL project using JOINs and aggregations to analyze Salesmen, Customers, and Orders data. Focused on query optimization and data management.

I‚Äôve recently completed a comprehensive SQL project where I worked with multiple tables, performing complex queries, joins, and aggregations on a database related to Salesmen, Customers, and Orders. This project helped me deepen my understanding of database management and SQL query writing.

# üìä Project Highlights:

Worked with data from three interconnected tables: SALESMEN, CUSTOMER, and ORDER.

Performed a variety of tasks including SELECT statements, JOINs, aggregations, and grouping.

Implemented advanced SQL concepts like filtering with operators, using functions, and handling NULL values.

Covered a wide range of queries, from basic data retrieval to complex joins and aggregations, improving the efficiency and accuracy of data analysis.

# üîç Some of the key queries I worked on include:

Displaying salesmen data, filtering by city or commission rate.

Joining multiple tables to fetch relevant information such as customer names and corresponding salesmen.

Aggregating data like order amounts, total sales by date, and identifying the largest orders for each salesperson.

Handling NULL values and performing complex filtering using operators like IN, BETWEEN, and LIKE.

# üí° Skills Demonstrated:

SQL (Join, Aggregate Functions, Group By, Where Clauses)

Data Analysis & Database Query Optimization

Complex Problem-Solving with Real-World Business Data

This project was a great opportunity to strengthen my SQL skills and apply them to realistic scenarios. I look forward to taking on more challenges and continuing to grow as a data professional.
